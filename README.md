2018.10-2018.12 Quantitative Internships Projects
# MAIN PROJECTS including:
# 1.Analysis of factor performance
## alphalens
* Analysis of factor performance of PS factor in Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 sub-units under the holding period of 5th, 30th and 60 days with Alphalens
* Call factor indicator analysis and visualization analysis methods to see the effects
## signaldigger
* Analysis of factor performance of PE factor in Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 sub-units under the holding period of 5th, 30th and 60 days by Signaldigger
* Call factor indicator analysis and visualization analysis methods to see the effects

# 2.Talib, Data Processing and JAQS
## 2.1 Data calculation and statistical analysis
### 2.1.1 Calculate the correlation coefficient between stock 600104.XSHG and 600518.XSHG, spearman sort correlation and 30 days rolling 5th earnings covariance
### 2.1.2
Read 600104. XSHG's stock day line

Aggregate the daily K line into a weekly K line

Draw the weekly K line.

### 2.1.3 Read stock 601857.XSHG data, calculate stock return, Judge sample in 2017-01-01, to 2017-12-31, do not obey the normal distribution, and determine whether the sample mean is 0
### 2.1.4 Using the recursive function of pandas to calculate EMA and DEMA, compare the EMA and DEMA in talib

## 2.2 Analytics Tools
### 2.2.1 Alphalens was used to analyze the factor performance of FLOAT_MV factor in Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 subunit under the holding period of 5th, 30th and 60 days.
### 2.2.2 Visualize the 10th rate of change of CCI, divert (custom), Pb, the rate of change of Vwap_adj of 10th, the average IC and ic_ir of the 4 factors under the holding period of 5th, 30th and 60 days
### 2.2.3 Select the largest 3 factors in 5-day ic_ir to do the factor combination (the factor to de-extremum and z-score standardized processing, the final combination of factors also need to be z-score standardized processing), and the histogram to compare the factors generated by the combination of methods and the original factor in the 5th holding period of the IC and IC_ IR; The method of calling index analysis and visualization analysis to view the factor performance synthesized by ic_weight method, and to save the results of stock selection with the best performance quantile under the synthesis method.

## 2.3 Factor preprocessing & Multi-factor combination & Visualization comparison

# 3 Data acquisition and factor performance
## Factor One: MACD
## Factor Two: CMO
# 4 Signal Hypothesis
# 5 Implementation of assumptions
* Using the three performance tables of timingsignal final output long, short, long_short
